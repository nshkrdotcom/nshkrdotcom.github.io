## Proposal for New Cybersecurity Initiatives

### Introduction

As our reliance on complex and un-auditable computing and networking systems continues to grow, the need for a fundamental recalibration of our approach to security design has become increasingly urgent. The current approach, which prioritizes innovation, user experience, and other factors over security, has resulted in significant tail risks that threaten the integrity of our systems and the safety of our data. In this proposal, we outline new cybersecurity initiatives that aim to address these risks and establish baseline security principles that are adaptable to the rapidly changing landscape of technology.

### Initiatives

* **Threat Modeling**: We propose the development of a comprehensive threat modeling framework that incorporates an outlook to at least 2050. This framework will involve speculation, extrapolation, and imagination, but will be grounded in empirical evidence and expert analysis. The goal of this initiative is to identify likely threat vectors and anticipate potential security risks before they can be exploited.

* **Black Box Auditing**: We propose the development of new auditing methodologies that can effectively evaluate the security of complex and un-auditable systems. This initiative will involve the development of new tools and techniques that can uncover vulnerabilities in black box systems and provide actionable recommendations for improving security.

* **Security-by-Design**: We propose the integration of security-by-design principles into the development of new computing and networking systems. This initiative will involve the establishment of baseline security principles that prioritize security over other factors and promote the development of more secure and resilient systems from the ground up.

* **Stakeholder Engagement**: We propose the establishment of a stakeholder engagement process that can effectively communicate the importance of security to decision-makers and incentivize the prioritization of security over other factors. This initiative will involve the development of new communication strategies, such as threat modeling visualizations and security dashboards, that can effectively convey security risks to stakeholders.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the proposed cybersecurity initiatives represent a significant step forward in addressing the tail risks associated with complex and un-auditable computing and networking systems. By establishing new threat modeling frameworks, developing new auditing methodologies, integrating security-by-design principles, and engaging stakeholders in the security process, we can create a more secure and resilient technological landscape that is better able to protect our data and preserve the integrity of our systems.

Dear Colleagues,

Following up on our recent cybersecurity report, we are pleased to outline the steps we will be taking to achieve our proposed initiatives. We believe that these initiatives are critical to addressing the tail risks associated with complex and un-auditable computing and networking systems and protecting the integrity of our systems and data.

To achieve these goals, we will be seeking support from public funding, federal assistance, community cooperation, and open discussion with leading stakeholders in the technology industry, including companies. We are committed to ensuring that our initiatives are grounded in empirical evidence and expert analysis, and that they prioritize security over other factors.

Specifically, we will be taking the following steps:

* We will be seeking public funding to support the development of our threat modeling framework and the establishment of our stakeholder engagement process. We believe that these initiatives are critical to identifying likely threat vectors, anticipating potential security risks, and communicating the importance of security to decision-makers.

* We will be seeking federal assistance to support the development of our black box auditing methodologies. We believe that these methodologies are critical to evaluating the security of complex and un-auditable systems and identifying vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

* We will be seeking community cooperation to promote the integration of security-by-design principles into the development of new computing and networking systems. We believe that this initiative is critical to promoting the development of more secure and resilient systems from the ground up.

* We will be seeking open discussion with leading stakeholders in the technology industry. We believe that these stakeholders have a critical role to play in promoting the prioritization of security over other factors and incentivizing the development of more secure and resilient systems.

We are committed to working with all stakeholders to achieve these goals and protect the integrity of our systems and data. We believe that the proposed initiatives represent a significant step forward in addressing the tail risks associated with complex and un-auditable computing and networking systems, and we look forward to collaborating with you to achieve these goals.
