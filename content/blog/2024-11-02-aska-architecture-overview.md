# ASKA Architecture: A Comprehensive Overview

[![ASKA Diagram 20241102](/ASKA-Overview-20241102-sm.png)](/ASKA-Overview-20241102.png)

This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the ASKA architecture, highlighting its key technologies and their interactions.  The system emphasizes modularity, robust security features, and dynamic adaptability.

## ASKA System

This top-level view encapsulates all components of a ASKA instance and its connections to external entities.

### ASKA Instance (Local)

This section details the core components within a single ASKA instance.

#### IES Cluster (P1)

The foundation of ASKA's hardware-enforced isolation. Multiple IES (Isolated Execution Stack) instances run different applications concurrently, each with dedicated hardware resources (CPU, memory, I/O, network). Key features include:

* **Dynamic Partitioning:** IES instances can be dynamically divided into smaller, isolated child-IES instances to optimize resource utilization and further enhance security.
* **Hierarchical Zones:**  Hierarchical zones within each IES, governed by mini-TRCs (Trust Root Configurations) stored on tamper-evident media (P13/P15), provide granular trust and policy management.
* **Secure Resource Borrowing (SRBM - P9):** Enables efficient resource utilization while maintaining isolation.
* **Secure Communication:** Inter-IES communication utilizes secure channels (P2, P3) and capability-aware forwarding (P26).  Local Security Meshes (LSMs - P2) monitor each IES instance and report to the Master Security Mesh (MSM - P2).
* **Data at Rest Encryption:**  The Hardware-Enforced Secure Encrypted Enclave for Data at Rest (HESE-DAR - P24) provides hardware-level encryption for data at rest.
* **Connections:** The IES Cluster connects to the DMNoC (Decentralized Mesh NoC), the MCN (Multi-Channel Network), the ASKA Hub, and the AI Agent.

#### DMNoC (Decentralized Mesh NoC)

A secure, high-bandwidth mesh network for inter-IES communication and connections to trusted external ASKA instances. Key features include:

* **Decentralized Mesh Topology:** Provides redundancy and fault tolerance.
* **Hardware Attestation (3D Microstructures - P14):** Ensures the integrity of DMNoC components.
* **Fiber Channel Interface:** Provides high-bandwidth connectivity to external networks.
* **Integration:**  The DMNoC integrates with the IES Cluster, DTMS, Policy Engine, and AI Agent.

#### MCN (Multi-Channel Network)

Provides secure communication channels for connecting to external networks (Internet, trusted networks). Key features include:

* **Multi-Channel Architecture (P3):** Physically segregated channels with dedicated firewalls prevent cross-channel interference.
* **Quantum-Resistant Communication (P5):**  Employs QKD, DKM, and PQC to secure communication against quantum computer attacks.
* **Dynamic Routing (P3):** Adapts to real-time security assessments and trust levels.
* **IAMA (P16):** Analyzes connected legacy systems to proactively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
* **Integration:** The MCN integrates with the IES Cluster, DTMS, Policy Engine, AI Agent, and IAMA.

#### ASKA Hub

The central management and control component for the local instance.  It orchestrates and manages all other components, enforcing policies, and managing resources.  It encompasses:

* **Dynamic Trust Management System (DTMS - P4):**  Manages trust relationships and access control based on dynamic metrics.
* **Policy Engine (P4):** Enforces security policies.
* **AI Agent (P36):** Monitors, analyzes, and adapts security measures.
* **Automated Evolutionary Software Development System (AESDS - P16):** Continuously updates and improves ASKA software.
* **Secure UI Kernel (P11):** Provides a secure user interface.
* **Key Management:**  Manages cryptographic keys for secure communication.

#### Dynamic Trust and Policy

This subgraph represents the core of ASKA's dynamic security, encompassing:

* **Bidirectional Communication:** DTMS, Policy Engine, and Capability Manager (P25) communicate bidirectionally, dynamically adjusting trust levels and capabilities.
* **Policy Influence:** Dotted lines show how trust levels and policies influence the IES Cluster, DMNoC, and MCN.


#### AI Agent (P36)

A crucial component responsible for:

* **System-wide Monitoring:**  Monitors all aspects of system behavior and network communication.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Employs AI/ML for detecting anomalies.
* **Adaptive Security:**  Coordinates security responses and dynamically adjusts security measures.
* **Policy Influence:** Provides recommendations and influences policy updates.


#### AESDS (P16)

The AI-driven system responsible for:

* **Continuous Software Updates:** Continuously monitors, updates, and improves ASKA's software.
* **Proactive Security Patching:** Proactively generates and deploys security patches and updates.
* **Integration:**  Manages updates across all ASKA components.


#### Secure UI Kernel (P11)

Provides a secure and isolated user interface environment with:

* **Zonal Isolation:** Isolates UI from the underlying system.
* **Hardware-Enforced Control-Flow Integrity (CFI):** Prevents code injection attacks.
* **Declarative Policy-Based Rendering:** Controls UI rendering based on policies.

#### Hardware Root of Trust (HRoT)

The foundation of ASKA's trust, providing:

* **Attestation:** Verifies the integrity of system components.
* **Key Generation:** Generates cryptographic keys.
* **Validation Services:**  Provides validation services to all modules.
* **Tamper-Proof Auditing:**  Creates tamper-proof auditable records via MDATS (P17) and 3D Microstructures (P14) utilizing the Decentralized Ledger (P13, P15).

### External Connections

#### External Mesh Network (Trusted)

ASKA instances connect and exchange information securely, leveraging the DMNoC's high-bandwidth capabilities.

#### External Networks

ASKA connects to various external networks (Internet, trusted networks) via the MCN, with IAMA (P16) monitoring and managing this interface.


## Key Features and Technologies

This section summarizes the core technologies underpinning ASKA's security and functionality:

* **Hardware-Rooted Trust (P1, P13, P33):**  Secure Boot, attestation, and 3D microstructures for tamper evidence.
* **Isolated Execution Stacks (P1):** Hardware-enforced isolation with dynamic partitioning and hierarchical zones for granular security.
* **Dynamic Trust Management (P4):**  Dynamic trust metrics, decentralized zone management, and policy negotiation for adaptive security.
* **Secure Communication Channels (P2, P3):**  Data diodes for unidirectional flows, multi-channel network with quantum-resistant options (P5).
* **AI-Driven Security (P2, P7, P36):**  Proactive threat detection, automated responses, and adaptive security policies.
* **Capability-Based Access Control (P25, P26):** Fine-grained access control at the data plane level.

* **Auditing and Accountability (P13, P15, P17):** Decentralized ledger, MDATS, and 3D microstructures for comprehensive auditing.


ASKA represents a paradigm shift in secure computing, offering a robust, adaptable, and trustworthy platform for high-assurance operations in diverse environments.  The modularity, dynamic adaptability, and multi-layered defense mechanisms address the limitations of traditional systems, creating a highly resilient and future-proof solution, especially in the context of evolving threats and the increasing importance of secure, decentralized computing.
